				having fun building a functional computer on breadboards.
				Personally, I'm into computers in all kinds of ways: designing CPU hardware, casual gaming from time to time,
				and programming ranging from an operating system for my CPU to sketching something fun and graphical up.

				GR8CPU is my project to build a fully functional computer on breadboards.
				The first version i built, <span title="GR8CPU, design revision 2">GR8CPU revision 2</span>,
				has easily over 600 wires, 74 integrated circuits and 79 LED lights. It is an 8-bit architecture with
				simplicity and processing power in mind. The CPU has access to 256 bytes of RAM,
				and i have written a fully functional <nobr>Tic-Tac-Toe</nobr> for it.<br><br>
				
				As of now, I'm working on building my second one, <span title="GR8CPU, design revision 3">GR8CPU Rev3</span>.
				The first CPU was loads of fun to work on, but my ambitions are higher: with 65536 bytes of memory,
				improved arithmetic and a much higher speed by design,
				this CPU is a contender for the most complex breadboard CPU ever made.<br><br>
				
				Whereas the flagship program for GR8CPU Rev2 is a game of <nobr>Tic-Tac-Toe</nobr>, the flagship program I'm working on now
				is a functional operating system inspired by the original unix, which is the grandfather of modern Linux, MacOS, BSD and android.<br><br>
