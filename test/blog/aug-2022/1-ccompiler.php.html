                <i>(Finally it's here in a demonstrable capacity!)</i><br><br>
                
                Today, I finished <a href="https://github.com/robotman2412/lily-cc"><nobr>Lily-CC</nobr></a>
                (my C compiler) just barely enough to complete a function call.
                There is <a href="https://youtu.be/Bho5XKOtkCE">a video demo</a> of what it can compile so far, but to sum it up:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>It compiled two functions,</li>
                <li>It made function position-independent code,</li>
                <li>It compiled a while loop,</li>
                <li>And it does string constants.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="justify">
                For the most part, that is all it can do.
                There are still many things (like for loops) that need to be made before C can be written.<br><br>
                
                Also shown in the video was a very small part of
                <a href="https://github.com/robotman2412/px16"><nobr>Pixie<sup>16</sup></nobr></a>
                (PX16 for short), the current target for Lily.
                It is much more finished than <nobr>Lily-CC</nobr> is, and is being held back by Lily's development.
                Why is a CPU being held back by a C compiler you may ask?
                Simple: I want to run programs written mostly in C.<br><br>
                
                However, with today's success this changes.
                There are only a handful of things that need to work before software testing on PX16 can begin.
                After all, the compiler doesn't need to be 100% finished before compiling code with it is viable.

                <nobr>Pixie<sup>16</sup></nobr> is my latest CPU design, incorporating every lesson I have learned.
                <span title="Short for Pixie 16">PX16</span> is a 16-bit RISC CPU with 4 general-purpose registers,
                3 special registers and 4 instructions.<br><br>
                
                I want to (and maybe it's not practical) have more users than just myself.
                The original goal was to make a little gameboy-sized computer with PX16,
                but I'm not sure that people will want to have one.
                Though my goals include low-power operation and simple enough to produce on a PCB,
                I'm not entirely sure what else I'd use for, so any suggestions are welcome.<br><br>
                
                Being made to contain no instruction set ROM, it could theoretically reach higher clock speeds.
                It also has an almost 100% IPC (Instructions Per Clock) uplift compared to GR8CPU Rev3.2,
                so it would actually perform even better compared to my previous design.<br><br>
                
                Specs for CPU nerds:
