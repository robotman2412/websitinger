				GR8CPU is my project to build a fully functional computer on breadboards.
				The first version i built, <span title="GR8CPU, design revision 2">GR8CPU revision 2</span>,
				has easily over 600 wires, 74 integrated circuits and 79 LED lights. It is an 8-bit architecture with
				simplicity and processing power in mind. The CPU has access to 256 bytes of RAM,
				and i have written a fully functional <nobr>Tic-Tac-Toe</nobr> for it.<br><br>
				
				As of now, I'm working on building my second one, <span title="GR8CPU, design revision 3">GR8CPU Rev3</span>.
				The first CPU was loads of fun to work on, but my ambitions are higher: with 65536 bytes of memory,
				improved arithmetic and a much higher speed by design,
				this CPU is a contender for the most complex breadboard CPU ever made.<br><br>
				
				Whereas the flagship program for GR8CPU Rev2 is a game of <nobr>Tic-Tac-Toe</nobr>, the flagship program I'm working on now
				is a functional operating system inspired by the original unix, which is the grandfather of modern Linux, MacOS, BSD and android.

				The building of GR8CPU isn't just copying from the design to breadboards.
				For practically all modules (except maybe the registers), I took the effort of transferring the design to
				paper, with all the logic gates and combinations laid out. With my design and datasheets as my guide,
				I start building. Here you see one of the first photos of the build i made, the RAM module.
				The RAM module contains all of the memory for the CPU, both data and program. The blue lights indicate
				the selected address and the yellow lights indicate the data at that address (here not hooked up yet).

				Here you see the RAM module, finished. I added some batteries to keep the RAM's content when the CPU is off.
				I also added an arduino used to load programs made on my computer into memory.
				This arduino would turn out to be a great idea, given the complexity of some of my programs.<br>
				Later, I would go to make a game of <nobr>Tic-Tac-Toe</nobr>, a prime calculator and the Fibonacci sequence,
				among other programs. I even had ambitions to hook a simple TTY screen and a controller up to this very limited CPU.
				After the making of the RAM, i would go to take a break from building on the CPU.

				The next thing i started work on is the ALU.
				The Arithmetic and Logic Unit is the part of a CPU that does all the calculations.
				The ALU has four basic operations:<br>
				- Add / Subtract,<br>
				- Shifting left / right,<br>
				- XOR,<br>
				- AND / OR.<br>
				Add and subtract are what you expect, with the limit of 255 that an 8-bit number imposes.
				AND, OR and XOR are bitwise operations, which means the operation is performed separately on every bit.
				From here it's pretty obvious: AND turns the output on if both inputs are on, OR if at least one is on,
				XOR when exactly one input is on (for two inputs).<br>
				With all of these calculations and some optimisations, I was just barely able to fit a complete game of
				<nobr>Tic-Tac-Toe</nobr> in memory. However, there was not enough memory to add an enemy AI, so you'll just
				have to play a two-player game.
