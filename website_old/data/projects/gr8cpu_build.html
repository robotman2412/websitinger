    Building GR8CPU Rev2, took longer than it seemed like it would.<br>
    Then again, i don't sit working on in 24 hours at a time.<br>
    This is mostly going to be a collection of pictures of the build, with little description.<br><br>
    I began the build with the registers (A, B and program counter), but i didn't take photos at the time.<br>
    Doesn't matter, because that was by far the least interesting part of the build.<br><br>
    Here you see an early photo of the RAM module, where i had just figured out how to get the RAM chip to work.<br>

    I had connected the RAM chip to an address register which gets written to before read or write.<br>
    I have also made an arduino based programmer here, for my programming convenience.<br>

    Here is a later photo of the registers which i <i>did</i> make.<br>

    This is the beginning of the ALU, with the input inverters and adders and ALU output bus already layed out.<br>

    Here, the ALU is finished, with all 5 operation types included.<br>
    I added a flags register to the bottom, which is what decides when to or when not to jump on a conditional branch instruction.<br>
    I also started work on the C register, which i commonly use as a decimal display, just because it's easier to read.<br>
    Above, you can see a temporary replacement clock, as the original was dysfunctional. The final clock would go to be just above the control unit.<br>

    This is the beginning of the control unit, with all the heavily planned circuits layed out.<br>
    The new clock is functional at this point.<br>
    The blue LEDs in the bottom left show you which control signals are active. I did not use this for debugging as much as i did for sci-fi looks.<br>

    The final CPU. I made a change after it was finished because of the RAM issue described in the previous project.<br>
    This program here is calculating prime numbers, another test i though of just before finishing my CPU build.<br>

    Don't make a mistake!<br>
    This project is far from done.<br>
    There is still a controller and TTY screen to make for the <nobr>Tic-Tac-Toe</nobr> game, if not more.
