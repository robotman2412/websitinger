    The CPU itself is currently finished.<br>
    But it's peripherals are most certainly not.<br>
    Because we need a screen!<br>
    And a controller.<br><br>
    The screen is a bit of a challenge, but it should be do-able.<br>
    It emulates 800x600 VGA, but the output signal is actually less then 200x150.<br>
    Why? Well, because the pixel clock otherwise needed would be 40MHz, wayyy too fast to be reliable on a breadboard.<br>
    Since it is a text display, i should tell you the resolution in characters also. It is 18 rows by 22 colomns.<br>
    Here you can see the current state of the TTY screen:<br>

<p>
    Right now, i'm working on actual display output.
    I have already made a screen recognise it, but i have not added character displaying yet.<br><br>
    Update:<br>
    I have not worked on this for a while because of exams, but i will continue shortly.<br>
    I will also make a controller of course, but sice it is so simple, i will include it here when i get to it.<br>
    Roadmap:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>display characters from RAM</li>
    <li>character writing triggers</li>
    <li>write characters in the current column</li>
    <li>write newline on \n or line overflow</li>
    <li>clear the new line</li>
    <li>test with GR8CPU</li>
</ol>
<p>
    Another update as of 13 July:<br>
    I have made a mistake while reading the datasheets for one of my integrated circuits.<br>
    The outputs are the opposite of what i expected them to be.
    This means that i will wait until my shipment of breadboards arrives, as i need more space to add inverters now.<br><br>
    Update as of 27 August:<br>
    I've recieved both the new breadboards and the will to build again.<br>
    Now, i'm working on more reading of all the bits.<br>
    After this, i can fill the entire screen with one character, marking the end of character drawing.<br><br>
    The beginning of this process can be seen below.

    Oh boy, i've done it again.<br><br>
    When i programmed the characterset into the EEPROMs, there was a bit of a bug in my programmer.<br>
    Said bug makes the data programmed completely unusable.<br>
    So now i need to program it again, but i have to manage to erase an EEPROM first.<br><br>
    Now, after programming, it works nicely.<br>
    As you can see, the screen now outputs some good stuff!

    What you can see here is the character set of the tty screen; every character that the thing will display is in this image.
    It's reminiscent of an early 80's terminal, and i think i really like the aesthetic of that.
    The next thing to do id to architect the rest of the thing. That means i will need to design exactly how the data part works,
    now that i've finished the video generation part.<br>
    Now, it would be ruse of me not to show another photo of the video card itself, wouldn't it?<br>
    Well, here is another progress picture!

    That's all fun, but that doesn't exactly show text with any meaning.<br><br>
    So i started working on the display logic.<br>
    After some headscratching and a slow Friday, there is progress:

    Yes, what you see here is the screen showing some static text.
    It does already have the functionality to scroll, but as the text is static, it won't do much more than that.<br><br>
    And here is the hardware that achieved that:

<p>
    However, as the text is static, it doesn't have the functionality to print to it like you would any other TTY screen.
    Plus, the font is not quite right, it has a few weird symbols that need changing.<br>
    These things will come another day.
