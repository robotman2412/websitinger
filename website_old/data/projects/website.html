	<h2 style="margin-top: 0;">OF MAKING A WEBSITE</h2>
</center>
<p>
	I've wanted to have a website for a while, and boy, was it a process.<br>
	The result is this very website!<br>
	In this project i will talk about:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Installing nginx and PHP an a raspberry PI</li>
	<li>Connecting the raspberry PI to a VLAN</li>
	<li>My first experiment in PHP</li>
	<li>A note about security</li>
	<li>Stylictic struggles</li>
	<li>What i'm working on now</li>
</ul>

<center><h1>Connecting the raspberry PI to a VLAN</h1></center>
...
<br><br>
<center><h1>A note about security</h1></center>
...
<br><br>
<center><h1>Stylistic struggles...</h1></center>
<p>
	Making the webserver has proven easier than making the website, mainly on a stylistic basis.<br>
	The first thing i was struggling with is the general page layout.<br>
	You can see an example here:<br>
	<center><img title="Click to enlarge..." class="fit-inline may-big" style="width:50%;right:auto;" src="/data/projects/images/progress0.png" width="1918" height="943"></center><br><br>
	Clearly, the layout has changed since then.<br>
	I wasn't satisfied with the fact that the background for the text was gray.<br>
	But i <i>was</i> satisfied with how the top bar looked.<br>
	<br>
	I also wanted an optional left bar to be there.<br>
	So, i went back to change the style, again.<br>
	And this is the result of that:<br>
	<center><img title="Click to enlarge..." class="fit-inline may-big" style="width:50%;right:auto;" src="/data/projects/images/progress1.png" width="1920" height="968"></center><br><br>
	But that isn't good enough.<br>
	You see, if your mouse isn't on the middle of the content, you won't be scrolling!<br>
	That's no fun!<br>
	So, i made a few changes and now the scrollbar is positioned more sensibly.<br>
	<br>
	Now, there's work to do on the project previews.<br>
	It's a bit of fiddling to get it to work nicely, but it was alot of fun to make.<br>
	Here, you'll see the first revision of the project preview seen in categories.

<p>
	The style, mostly.<br>
	I want the website to look nice and modern, but i'm not about to use a standard tool or template for that.<br>
	I want to make this on my own.
