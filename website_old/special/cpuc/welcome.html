		<h2>Welcome to CPU control!</h2>
	</center>
	With online CPU control, anyone in the world can upload programs to my breadboard CPU!<br><br><br><br>
	First, do you want to play with others' programs?<br>
	Put simply, you get a remote controller to play with games and stuff others made.<br>
	<button onclick="interact_r2()">play with GR8CPU Rev2.1</button>
	<!--<button onclick="interact_r3()">play with GR8CPU Rev3.1</button>!-->
	<br><br><br>
	If instead you want to program:<br>
	The CPU control system is based on jobs.<br>
	A job is simply something which can be run on the CPU.<br>
	There <i>will be</i> a "timer", which reports how long your job can run if submitted now, although if there is nobody else willing to submit a job, your may keep running longer.<br>
	This means that if you were advertised five minutes when you posted, you get five minutes regardless of most other circumstances.<br><br>
	<!--There is four types of jobs for GR8CPU Rev3.1:
	<ul>
		Text to be displayed,
		C / C++ program,
		Python program,
		Assembly program.
	</ul>!-->
	Right now, there's two types of job: text and assembly program.<br>
	Text simply displays a message of choosing and leaves it on screen for a time of choosing.<br>
	Assembly programming is much more complicated, but for an avid programmer should be do-able.<br><br><br>
	If you want to post a job, i strongly recommend to first send some text:<br>
	<button onclick="openEditableTab('/special/cpuc/example/example_text.txt', 'text', 'hello world.txt');triggerInfo('getting_started_text')">text file example</button><br><br>
	Of course, interaction is great and text does not have this,
	so if you would like to start programming, there is no better way than with examples:<br>
	<button onclick="examples()">examples</button><br><br>
</div>
