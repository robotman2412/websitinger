<h3>Why log in with google?</h3>
Logging in with google means that you can stay in the queue for interacting with a CPU.<br>
You can optionally tell us to email you if it's almost your turn.<br>
If you want to use special privileges, you must log in with google so we can make sure it's you.<br>
<br>
A task submitted for a CPU will run disregarding whether you are still online and as such, tasks can be submitted without logging in at all.<br>
<h3>Why log in right now?</h3>
Online CPU control is currently being worked on, and i need beta testers.<br>
But anyone would normally be able to interact with this system and that's not good while i'm testing this.<br>
If you are a beta tester, you can simply log in, but for anyone else there is currently nothing to do here.
