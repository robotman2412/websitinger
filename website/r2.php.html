				<h1>GR8CPU Rev2 breadboard CPU</h1>
			</center>
			<p>
				GR8CPU revision 2.1 is an 8-bit CPU made out of TTL logic on a series of breadboards.<br>
				It features a small screen to which letters and decorative characters can be written. It also has a controller used for interacting.<br>
				This CPU will be present at MCH2021, and if i finish it in time then so will be <a class="w" href="/r3">revision three</a>.

				But what <i>is</i> a CPU (Central Processing Unit)?<br>
				Many things in our daily lives contain a CPU by now, the primary example being of course you computer.
				If you edit documents often, it determines where and how to place text based on your interaction.
				If you visit websites often, it tells the GPU (Graphical Processing Unit) how to display the website.
				Think of a CPU as an automatic calculator. It can do all of the things your pocket calculator can do.
				And even better, it does it automatically and based on results it can do more complex things like move around data.<br>
				To set straight a common misconception: A CPU will never make mistakes, it will only follow it's programming.
				If it looks like a mistake, it was most likely a mistake or oversight of the person(s) that made the program in question.<br>
				A well made CPU is an incredibly powerful tool and as such, many things may suddenly contain a CPU of some sort.
				There is a whole list, and thing like fridges (to keep the temperature in check), ovens (temp. again and also timers), cars (safety) and even some lights (remote control)
				can have CPUs in them, just to name a few.<br><br>
				If you want to play with one of my CPUs, you will need to go to my online CPU control.
				Note that the "emulated" variants are not real and are there to help programmers work on their programs.
				Therefor, pick one of the <i>real</i> variants, you can interact with it or reserve a spot in the queue for interacting in case there if other people that wish to play.<br><br>

			<p>
				Note: <a class="w" href="/r3#programming-intro">Programming for GR8CPU revision 3</a> will be much easier if you are not familiar with assembly.<br><br>
				If you want to program for GR8CPU Rev2, you will need to be familiar with the concept of assembly first.<br>
				Assembly is a simple programming language structure used for programming at pretty much the lowest possible level.<br><br>
				When programming in assembly, there is one most important thing to keep in mind:<br>
				The assembler will directly translate everything into the program in order.
				This means that putting data before instructions is guaranteed to lead to unwanted behaviour, as GR8CPU Rev2 starts running programs at address 0.<br><br>
				This gets us to the next point. What is an address in the context of assembly?<br>
				An address represents a place in the CPU's memory, for GR8CPU Rev2 there is no way to tell what kind of data will be found at the address.
				This means that there can be either (a part of) an instruction or data put there by the programmer.<br>
				An assembler takes away the need to manually find these addresses and as such, using an assembler is much easier than directly writing a runnable program.<br><br>
				Below, you will see an example of part of an assembly program:
			</p>
			<div class="asm">
				<span class="comment">; this is a comment, anything from the ';' on is ignored by the assembler</span><br><br>
				label1 &nbsp; <span class="insn">load</span> some_place_in_memory <span class="comment">; some_place_in_memory is defined elsewhere</span>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="insn">store</span> label2 <span class="comment">; we store this so another part of the program may use it</span>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
				<br><br>
				label2 &nbsp; <span class="data">data</span> <span class="val">$00</span> <span class="comment">; "data" will be described later</span>
			</div>
			<p>
				First, a label is defined by putting a name at the start of the line.
				Doing this will make the assembler associate that name with an address.
				It is important to note that nothing is ever <i>assigned</i> to a label, rather something is assigned to the <i>place</i>
				in memory that the label represents.<br>
				This is why the data $00 works. It is not a constant, but rather the line is used to reserve a byte in memory.
				"Writing" to the label replaces the value we put there.<br><br>
				Next, you must understand how instructions behave for GR8CPU Rev2.
				It is important you remember this applies only to GR8CPU Rev2.<br>
				GR8CPU Rev2 has three registers you can programmatically use: The A, C and D registers.<br>
				The B register <i>does</i> exist, but is hidden from the programmer.<br>
				Each register is one byte in size, meaning they can count from 0 to 255, or -128 to 127, depending if you interpret numbers as being negative.<br><br>
				The A register is used by almost all instructions. When you load, a value is placed into A and storing does the reverse.<br>
				The A register is also used for all calculations without exception.
				Instructions that imply they don't use the A register but still do a calculation <i>will always</i> overwrite A and then store back to where it needs to go.
				This has the side effect that you can directly increment a place in memory and yet still have that also be written to A.<br><br>
				The C register is used for data storage. You may put anything in it and no instruction will mess with it trough side effects.<br><br>
				The D register is special for GR8CPU Rev2. It does not <i>actually</i> store data, and instead it is used for interacting with the outside world.
				Writing <i>to</i> the D register will write that, as a character, to the screen.<br>
				Reading <i>from</i> the D register will make GR8CPU Rev2 wait for controller input and then continue.<br><br>
				No follows another example:
			</p>
			<div class="asm">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="insn">load</span> <span class="val">#'H'</span><br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="insn">copy</span> <span class="insa">A to D</span><br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="insn">load</span> <span class="val">#'i'</span><br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="insn">copy</span> <span class="insa">A to D</span><br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="insn">load</span> <span class="val">#'!'</span><br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="insn">copy</span> <span class="insa">A to D</span>
			</div>
			<p>
				This shows two things.<br>First, the '#' followed by a character.<br>
				The '#' means that whatever is loaded is not loaded from memory, but instead as a constant.<br>
				You may put a character after it, but any other number will also work, even labels.
				This is consistent for many instructions: Almost every instruction has a memory referencing variant (without '#') and a constant variant (with '#').<br>
				Note that not every instruction actually has an argument.<br><br>
				Next, this implies that "Hi!" is shown somewhere, and in fact it is.<br>
				Each time we do "<span class="asm"><span class="insn">copy</span> <span class="insa">A to D</span></span>" we print the character we just loaded.<br>
				Especially copying between registers makes it important you know that many instructions reference the A register.<br><br>
				For now, this leaves only one thing to do.<br>
				Go now to <a class="w" href="/cpu_control#example">my online CPU control</a> and play around with the examples and their challenges.<br>
				Doing this, you will also need <a class="w" href="/isa_gr8cpur2">the instruction set reference for GR8CPU Rev2</a>.
