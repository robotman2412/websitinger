    <h1 style="margin-bottom: 0;">screening CPUs</h1>
    <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">is not the right term</h3>

    The CPU itself is currently finished.<br>
    But it's peripherals are most certainly not.<br>
    Because we need a screen!<br>
    And a controller.<br><br>
    The screen is a bit of a challenge, but it should be do-able.<br>
    It emulates 800x600 VGA, but the output signal is actually less then 200x150.<br>
    Why? Well, because the pixel clock otherwise needed would be 40MHz, wayyy too fast to be reliable on a breadboard.<br>
    Since it is a text display, i should tell you the resolution in characters also. It is 18 rows by 22 colomns.<br>
    Here you can see the current state of the TTY screen:<br>

<p>
    Right now, i'm working on actual display output.
    I have already made a screen recognise it, but i have not added character displaying yet.<br><br>
    Update:<br>
    I have not worked on this wor a while because of exams, but i will continue shortly.<br>
    I will also make a controller of course, but sice it is so simple, i will include it here when i get to it.<br>
    Roadmap:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>display characters</li>
    <li>display characters from RAM</li>
    <li>character writing triggers</li>
    <li>write characters in the current column</li>
    <li>write newline on \n or line overflow</li>
    <li>clear the new line</li>
    <li>test with GR8CPU</li>
</ol>
