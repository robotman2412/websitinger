				<h2>so you want to program my CPUs</h2>
			</center>
			<p class="note">
				This page and the pages related to programming my CPUs are all Work-In-Progress.<br>
				I expect it to take at least until July 10th to get most of this done.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is where you get started.<br>
				As GR8CPU Rev3.1 is not done, you can currently only program GR8CPU Rev2.1 in assembly.<br>
				I am most certainly planning on letting you program GR8CPU Rev3.1 in C/C++ when it's done.
			</p>
			<h3>programming GR8CPU Rev2.1 in assembly</h3>
			<p>
				First, you must read the <a class="w" href="/techdesc_gr8cpur2">technical description of GR8CPU Rev2.1</a>.<br>
				This is by far the most important information, because you need to know a bit of behind-the-scenes to program assembly.<br><br>
				Next, may want to read read the <a class="w" href="/guide_assembler">guide to using my assembler</a>.<br>
				This shows the general structure of an assembly program, and is also very helpful. You may also skip this, but i recommend reading it.<br><br>
				Finally, i advise you to go to my <a class="w" href="/cpu_control">online CPU control</a>,
				as you can easily test all sorts of programs here without installing anything.<br>
				Simply click on the "hello world" example and program away.<br><br>
				If you do want to install software, you need to go to my <a href="/cpu_resources" class="w">CPU resources page</a>.<br>
				It will contain all the resources needed to try this on your own (not yet done).<br>
