				<h3>prerequisites and terminology</h3>
				
				HEX, Hexadecimal:<br>
				<div class="indented">
					Prerequisite, you must understand this fully.<br>
					Like our decimal number system, but with 16 digits, as such the name.<br>
					The six extra are a-f, resulting in a case-insensitive 0123456789ABCDEF.<br>
					Hexadecimal is often used on this low level instead of decimal because it makes you think
					more carefully around what numbers your processor can understand.
				</div><br>
				Signed / unsigned: signed can be a negative number, unsigned cannot.<br><br>
				Instruction: Single operation a CPU does, one on it's own is usually not useful.<br><br>
				RISC: Irrelevant, look it up for more info.<br><br>
				word in the context of a CPU:<br>
				<div class="indented">
					What the CPU can directly read.<br>
					This CPU had a word size of 8 bits.<br><br>
					This means the way to find the biggest numbers easily stored is as follows:<br>
					Unsigned: 2<sup>number of bits</sup> - 1<br>
					Signed (minimum): -2<sup>bits-1</sup><br>
					Signed (maximum): 2<sup>bits-1</sup> - 1<br><br>
					Or for GR8CPU Rev2.1:<br>
					Unsigned: 2<sup>8</sup> - 1 = 255<br>
					Signed (minimum): -2<sup>7</sup> = -128<br>
					Signed (maximum): 2<sup>7</sup> - 1 = 127<br>
				</div><br>
				register: Stores one word for the CPU, for later use.
				
				<h3>architecture</h3>
				
				The GR8CPU family is an 8-bit RISC CPU architecture with 4 registers.<br>
				In revision 2.1, these are:<br>
				<div class="indented">A - used for most things, including calculations</div>
				<div class="indented">B - hidden from the programmer's eye, used as B argument or temporary storage</div>
				<div class="indented">C - for programmer's storage, has ALU instructions for it as well</div>
				<div class="indented">D - used for I/O, the CPU cannot tell the difference</div>
				The D register has a controller on it and reading it halts until a button is pressed.<br>
				The controller has a switch to disable this feature.<br>
				The D register has a text screen that is written to when the D register is written to.<br><br>
				There are two flags output from the ALU:<br>
				<div class="indented">zero - result from calculation was zero when disregarding carry out</div>
				<div class="indented">carry out - a bit that was on was shifted out, or carry out from adder</div>
				These output flags are set when any operation is performed, including comparison.<br>
				They are processed in the
				<a class="w" href="/isa_gr8cpur2#insn_12">conditional "branching" jump instructions</a>.<br><br>
				The memory for GR8CPU Rev2 is very simple.<br>
				It has 256 bytes of memory (no joke), all for your use.<br>
				Both the program and data live in the same memory and as such self-modifying code is possible,
				and has in fact been used in multiple programs.
				
				<h3>instructions</h3>
				
				The instructions for GR8CPU Rev2 follow one of two formats:
				<div class="indented">opcode byte</div>
				<div class="indented">opcode byte, argument byte (may be an address)</div>
				There is no immediate way to tell the difference other than to see the instruction listing.<br>
				Invalid instructions use the former one, as by definition they do nothing.<br>
				The opcode refers to the byte inserted in the program to signify a certain instruction.<br><br>
				Most instructions refer to the A register.<br>
				"load" loads a bit of data into the "A" register, "store" stores the "A" register somewhere, and so on.<br>
				ALU instructions like "add", "sub", "inc", "dec" and more all set the ALU flags when used.<br>
				Furthermore, <b>these instructions store the result into the "A" register</b> (if they have one because "comp" does not).<br>
				This is very important, because it depicts the flow of the program.<br>
				Which gets me to:
				
				<h3>from a programmer's perspective</h3>
				
				There are two registers, "A" and "C", you can use.<br>
				"A" stores everything you're currently working with and "C" stores anything you want it to.<br>
				This is also very important, because it too depicts the flow of the program.<br>
				There is a special "D" register.<br>
				Writing to it writes that as a character on the screen.<br>
				Reading from it waits for controller input.<br><br>
				By far the most used instructions are loading and calculating.<br>
