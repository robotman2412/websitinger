					<h2>guide to using my assembler</h2>
				</center>
				<p>
					My assembler is currently the only tool to program my CPUs.<br>
					Here, i make a guide to using the assembler.<br><br>
					See also:<br>

				<h2>in case of online CPU control</h2>
				<p>
					Go <a class="w" href="#programming">understanding how to program in assembly</a>,
					as the assembler is not used for online CPU control.
				</p><br><br><br><br><br><br>
				<a name="install"></a><h3>1. installing the assembler</h3>
				<p>
					The assembler is a small java program, you can download it and put it anywhere.<br>
					<a href="https://www.java.com/download/">You need Java&trade; installed tu run it.</a><br>
					There will be command line support in the future, working on this now in fact.<br>
					It creates a folder named "data" and it stores the paths of your last assembled file in there.<br>
					If it continually crashes, you may try to remove this folder, as it stores no critical data.<br>
					You can download it <a class="w" href="/resource/Assembler.jar">via this link</a>.<br>
					Your browser and/or operating system may warn you about viruses if you download this.<br>
					Then just put it where you want (i put it in my projects folder) and run it by double-clicking.<br>
				</p>
				<a name="starting"></a><h3>2. getting started: as application</h3>
				<p>
					Double click on the Assembler.jar you downloaded.<br>
					The screen you see will look similar to this:<br>
					<img class="fit-inline may-big" src="/data/assembler_start.png" title="Click to enlarge."><br>
					You will need two things: An assembly guide and a source file.<br>
					The assembly guide tells my assembler exactly how to compile a program for a certain CPU.<br>
					The assembly guides can be found in my <a class="w" href="/cpu_resources">CPU resources page (coming soon)</a>.<br>
					You will need to download the assembly guide for the CPU you want to make a program for.<br>
					As one may know, press the select button per input or output file to select which file you want.<br>
					My <a class="w" href="/cpu_resources">CPU resources page (coming soon)</a>
					will also have some of the programs i made for my CPUs and the files needed to emulate my CPUs.<br>
				</p>
				<a name="commandline"></a>
				<a name="programming"></a><h3>3. making your own programs</h3>
				<p>
					This will not go over each CPU individually, for that you will need to look at
					<a href="/programming_cpus" class="w">so you want to program my CPUs</a>.<br>
					This also assumes you have experience with a modern programming language.<br>
					However, this will contain important information as to how the assembler functions.<br><br>
					First, i need you to understand what comes first in the file will come first in the program.<br>
					If you put data first, the CPU <i>will</i> try to run it, as it doesn't tell the difference.
					This is why an instruction always comes before data.<br><br>
					Here you see an assembly program:<br>
				</p>
				<x-incl id="asmfragment_example" type="asm" src="/special/gr8cpu/asmexample.asm" style="gr8cpur2_1"></x-incl><br>
				<p>
					"load", "store" and "halt" halt here are what is called instructions.
					<br><br>
					You can see that both start and someplace are labels.
					A label can be used to set a constant value, or to resolve an address.
					Where you would otherwise put a value, you can also place a label.<br>
					You can perform simple calculation to set a label.
					<nobr>With * / + - and</nobr> braces.<br>
					Labels are always placed at the very start of a line.<br><br>
					The data keyword is not highlighted here and i don't know why,
					But the keywords data, byte and bytes serve the same function.
					They signify data, whether that is a single byte or an entire string.<br><br>
					About data types--<br>
					There is 5 types which you can put in your program:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Hexadecimal, prefixed with $, but not 0x</li>
					<li>Decimal (positive or negative), just put it without prefix or suffix.</li>
					<li>Octal, for my old assembly fans, suffixed with either 'o' or 'q'</li>
					<li>Character, one long string</li>
					<li>String, either in " or in '</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					If you know C/C++, you know a c-string is terminated with \0. Here you need to do that explicitly.
					Also, character constant is simply any string with a length of 1,
					it may be used as any other byte where strings may not.<br><br>
					The reserve keyword reserves a number of bytes, sets them all to 0 and is typically used with a label.
					I have not had a good use for it so far, but later on i might, which is why i added it.<br><br>
					On the general format of how values are included in a program.<br>
					Here you see another assembly program:
				</p>
				<x-incl type="asm" id="asmfragment_valueincl" src="/special/gr8cpu/asmvalueincl.asm" style="gr8cpur2_1"></x-incl><br>
				<p>
					Here comes a trend in instruction definitions.<br>
					Any instruction which deals with an absolute value rather than an address, prefixes the value with #.
					This is not something that defines your value, but rather something that defines which instruction to use,
					as otherwise there are sometimes two instructions which would look completely identical.<br><br>
					You see here the "load #'.'" loads the character '.',
					where as the "load $00" would load the value at address $00 (0) in memory.<br>
					Similarly, there is no "store #", because you don't store to a value, you store to an address.<br><br>
					This is consistent in all my instruction set definitions.<br><br>
					To continue with simple things, look at my example programs found in the
					<a class="w" href="/cpu_resources">CPU resources page (coming soon)</a>.
				</p>
				<a name="debug"></a>
				<h3>debugging: finding "your" errors</h3>
				<p>
					As with a lot of programs, nothing is guaranteed to immediately work.<br>
					Especially at this low level.<br>
					That is why i have an assembly dump system.<br><br>
					In case you're using the assembler software, simple press the "open dump file" button.<br>
					In case of online CPU control, you should already be seeing an assembly dump.<br><br>
					The assembly dump differs slightly per platform, but is a useful tool that lets you see what goes where.<br>
					It is slightly complex to do, but you look up the program counter's value in the assembly dump so
					you can see where it's currently running code, and you will quickly start to recognise the instructions by hexadecimal value.<br><br>
					Unfortunately, i cannot find a way to describe it other than a way to look up what your CPU is running and what it will run.<br>
					You can contact me on twitter (link in the footer below) if you are having trouble.
				</p>
				<a name="advanced"></a>
				<h3>advanced programming: metadata</h3>
				<p>
					As of right now, there is four types of metadata.<br>
					You place these at the beginning of the line:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>@include "path/tosomefile.asm"</li>
					<li>@no_padding</li>
					<li>@charset "path/tosomecharset.wchs"</li>
					<li>* = (some calculation or value)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The @include metadata literally includes said file into your program as more program.<br>
					The path may be relative to the program directory, or an absolute path.<br>
					Such an included program cannot have most types of metadata, it will be ignored.<br><br>
					The @charset tells the assembler what characters in a string or character correspond to what
					bytes in the final program, the path works like the one of @include.<br>
					Charactersets are also included in my <a class="w" href="/cpu_resources">CPU resources page (coming soon)</a>.<br><br>
					The @no_padding metadata must be placed before even the starting address definition,
					as it changes how it works.<br>
					<span class="note">Good practice, functionally not required.</span>
					You see, the starting address is usually "padded out" with words of value 0,
					from actual address 0 until it gets to where you put your program.<br>
					The @no_padding removes this and makes the assembler simply assume you will place it there.<br><br>
					The "* = ..." metadata can actually be used multiple times,
					and can be used in included files.<br>
					The @no_padding part will only remove the padding from address 0 to the starting address.<br>
					It is only the starting address if there is no instructions before it, because of the next behaviour.<br>
					If not used as the starting address, it will still set the address to the place (from that point in the file on),
					allowing you to divide the program into pieces living in specific parts of memory.

				<h3>if you want to do everything at a glance</h3>
				<p>
					I would not recommend it, but this is where to start.<br>
					Highlighting is not perfect, but it might help just a little bit.<br>
					You must <a class="w" href="#install">install everything first</a>, you can't do that at a glance.<br>
					If you read it, i advise to play around with example programs provided in the
					<a class="w" href="/cpu_resources">CPU resources page (coming soon)</a>.<br><br>
					Here comes the airplane!
