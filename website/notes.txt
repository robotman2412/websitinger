Notes related to MCH2021 :)


I got these from the badge team meeting a attended.

This will be cool.

Badge displays may be color. (SPI/parralel, ESP/FPGA)
-> ESP can program FPGA

Sebastius wants to go towards the open badge like the SHA2017 badge.
Games may be completely optional.

We want to have a hatchery upload button.

WebUSB
-> STM32
-> ESP32-S2?
WebUSB gives browsers access to USB.
This will make programming easier.

FM-rx
Villages can tx something locally.
Not core component, probably.

Navsystem
This'd be great.
HyperGPS / Wifi AP based triangulation.

FPGA
Additive, but could destroy budget.

Badge <--> Campsite objects interaction

Software upkeep.
-> Adafruit circuitpython thingy
  -> We can focus on features
  -> ESP32-S2 is in dev at Adafruit
