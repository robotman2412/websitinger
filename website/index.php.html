				Personally, I'm into computers in all kinds of ways: designing CPU hardware, casual gaming from time to time,
				and programming ranging from an operating system for my CPU to sketching something fun and graphical up.

				MCH2021 was canceled a while ago when it became clear that <i>some odd virus</i> would make it unsafe.<br><br>
				Now, however there is good news: MCH2021 is now MCH2022.
				In other words, MCH2021 has been moved to 2022, exact date to be determined.<br><br>

				Since last I wrote an update, i've made some more progress: the B register is now here and connected to the ALU.

				GR8CPU is my project to build a fully functional computer on breadboards.
				The first version i built, <span title="GR8CPU, design revision 2">GR8CPU revision 2</span>,
				has easily over 600 wires, 74 integrated circuits and 79 LED lights. It is an 8-bit architecture with
				simplicity and processing power in mind. The CPU has access to 256 bytes of RAM,
				and i have written a fully functional <nobr>Tic-Tac-Toe</nobr> for it.<br><br>
				
				As of now, I'm working on building my second one, <span title="GR8CPU, design revision 3">GR8CPU Rev3</span>.
				The first CPU was loads of fun to work on, but my ambitions are higher: with 65536 bytes of memory,
				improved arithmetic and a much higher speed by design,
				this CPU is a contender for the most complex breadboard CPU ever made.<br><br>
				
				Whereas the flagship program for GR8CPU Rev2 is a game of <nobr>Tic-Tac-Toe</nobr>, the flagship program I'm working on now
				is a functional operating system inspired by the original unix, which is the grandfather of modern Linux, MacOS, BSD and android.<br><br>
