				My website is a place where I make write-ups about all my projects and magical thingies.

				having fun building a functional computer on breadboards.
				Personally, I'm into computers in all kinds of ways: designing CPU hardware, casual gaming from time to time,
				and programming ranging from an operating system for my CPU to sketching something fun and graphical up.<br><br>
				
				I also have a <a href="/blog/">blog</a> now, where I'll be posting status updates on projects and alike.

				After some puzzling and overthinking deceptively simple math, I managed to render a 3D model with lighting,
				and even in 3D anaglyph!

				In summer 2020, I started volunteering for the MCH2022 <nobr>Badge.Team</nobr>.
				I really wanted to contribute, but at first I didn't know where to start.
				So, I tried making an app for <a rel="external" target="_blank" href="https://wiki.sha2017.org/w/Projects:Badge">the SH2017 badge</a>.<br><br>
				
				That is when I realised. There is no way to perform transformations.
				There isn't even a way to draw a triangle!<br><br>
				
				So, I got to work creating some better graphics for them.
				And now, for the <a rel="external" target="_blank" href="https://wiki.mch2022.org/Badge">MCH2022 badge</a>,
				I was asked to write the graphics stack.<br><br>

				GR8CPU is my project to build a fully functional computer on breadboards.
				The first version i built, <span title="GR8CPU, design revision 2">GR8CPU revision 2</span>,
				has easily over 600 wires, 74 integrated circuits and 79 LED lights. It is an 8-bit architecture with
				simplicity and processing power in mind. The CPU has access to 256 bytes of RAM,
				and i have written a fully functional <nobr>Tic-Tac-Toe</nobr> for it.<br><br>

				As of now, I'm working on building my second one, <span title="GR8CPU, design revision 3">GR8CPU Rev3</span>.
				The first CPU was loads of fun to work on, but my ambitions are higher: with 65536 bytes of memory,
				improved arithmetic and a much higher speed by design,
				this CPU is a contender for the most complex breadboard CPU ever made.<br><br>

				Whereas the flagship program for GR8CPU Rev2 is a game of <nobr>Tic-Tac-Toe</nobr>, the flagship program I'm working on now
				is a functional operating system inspired by the original unix, which is the grandfather of modern Linux, MacOS, BSD and android.<br><br>
