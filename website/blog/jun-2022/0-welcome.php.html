				I guess I have this now!<br><br>
				
				With MCH2022 coming up, I'm dusting off my website.
				After writing to the projects section for a bit,
				I realised that it's better if that's reserved for info and FAQs about the project,
				instead of the sort-of-blog thing I was doing with it.<br><br>
				
				I also made a mailinglist you can subscribe to for blog posts, so you'll never miss one <nobr>;)</nobr><br><br>
				
				So that's where I am! I will be posting more to the blog as I make progress on projects,
				and I'll be linking to the project page instead of editing it every time.
